Scratch for Holiday
===================

Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) is a graphical programming language designed to teach children the fundamentals of coding and computer science.

Scratch 2.0, released in 2013, introduced the capability for 'Extensions' - blocks that can interact with Scratch.

Scratch for Holiday is an implementation of a Scratch extention that allows Scratch to control Holiday by MooresCloud (holiday.moorescloud.com).

This code was developed with the greatful assistance of (and code freely lifted from) the Google Chrome webserver example - https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/webserver
