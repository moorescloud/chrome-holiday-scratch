Scratch for Holiday
===================

Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) is a graphical programming language designed to teach children the fundamentals of coding and computer science.

Scratch 2.0, released in 2013, introduced the capability for 'Extensions' - blocks that can interact with Scratch.

Scratch for Holiday is an implementation of a Scratch extention that allows Scratch to control Holiday by MooresCloud (holiday.moorescloud.com).

It's still very early days with this code - it barely works, and has uncovered a few bugs in Scratch - but the goal is to make Holiday programming as easy in Scratch as moving a sprite.

Usage
-----

* Scratch for Holiday will scan your network for Holidays. Select the Holiday(s) you'd like to control from Scratch. (You can select more than one.)
* Once you've made some selections, launch the offline version of Scratch 2.0 (linky goes here)
* TBD
